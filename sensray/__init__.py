Lightweight public package API. This module intentionally exposes only a
small set of stable, well-maintained entry points: `PlanetModel`,
`PlanetMesh`, and utilities like `CoordinateConverter`.

The package previously included higher-level wrappers for ray tracing,
travel-times and plotting. Those were intentionally removed in favor of
using ObsPy/TauP and dedicated visualization tools directly.
